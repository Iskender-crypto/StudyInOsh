            The Paramount Theatre was a movie palace in downtown Atlanta,
            Georgia, United States. The building was designed by Philip T.
            Shutze and was completed in 1920 as the Howard Theatre, a name it
            kept until 1929. It was located along Peachtree Street, in an area
            that soon became the location of several other major theaters.
